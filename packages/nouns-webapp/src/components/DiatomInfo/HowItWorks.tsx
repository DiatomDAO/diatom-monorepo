        <h3>The power of DeFi in a community-governed DAO</h3>
        <p>
          As a DAO, Diatom is owned and directed pro-rata by DIAT holders. Any action or change to
          the DAO is discussed and voted upon by token holders. This ensures the DAOâ€™s actions
          benefit all, and not just one small party.
